# Muffin Text
![alttext](/MTlogo.svg)
An Programming Language made entirely on TurboWarp. MT is a abreviation of Muffin Text.

Muffin Text is a project that brings TurboWarp to it's limits. By using Turbowarp as a VM, MT have it's own syntax, parser, executor, and editor.

# What is the objective of this project?

The goal of MT is not just to create an entire programming language within TurboWarp. Rather, it's to demonstrate that TurboWarp/Scratch can be used for basic things like animations and simple games, as well as for complex 3D games, x86 emulators, and even as a VM for a programming language. Sometimes what we underestimate can surprise us, at the moment we least expect it.
