# Muffin Text (MT)

**Muffin Text** is a programming language made entirely in **TurboWarp**.  
MT stands for *Muffin Text*.

This project pushes TurboWarp to its limits by using it as a **virtual machine**.  
MT has its own **syntax**, **parser**, **executor**, and **editor**, all running inside TurboWarp.

## Project Objective

The goal of Muffin Text is not just to create a programming language inside TurboWarp.

Its main purpose is to demonstrate that **TurboWarp and Scratch-like environments are far more powerful than commonly assumed**.  
They can be used not only for simple animations and games, but also for complex systems such as:
- 3D engines (Glue3D as a 3D Engine)
- Emulators (Some emulators can emulate x86 CPU instructions!)
- Virtual machines (A Linux VM with the x86 emulator)
- And now, a full programming language

Sometimes, what we underestimate surprises us the most.
